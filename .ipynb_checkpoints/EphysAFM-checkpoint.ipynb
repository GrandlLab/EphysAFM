Run the first cell then come down to the last cell and run the code with the appropriate path to the summary file for the dataset and the preprocessed sweeps for that dataset. We must change the backend so that we can interact with the plots. It will go through each individual sweep and plot the approach phase of the data with absolute current as a function of work done. You can manually select the region to be fit with a line by mousing over the region of interest on the plot.
